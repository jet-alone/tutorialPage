      <h2>What Do I Need To Know?</h2>
      <p>There are some concepts you may want to review before diving
        headfirst into JavaScript fundamentals. JavaScript helps make
        your webpage responsive and interactive. It helps to have knowledge
        of both HTML5 and CSS3 before diving into JavaScript. So what 
        exactly is JavaScript? JavaScript (or JS for short) is an
        object-oriented programming language. It has a multitude of uses, 
        such as running lines of code in response to events happening on
        a webpage, store values inside variables, and overall make your
        website more interesting to use!

        <p>Functions are by far one of the most important aspects of JavaScript.
          To understand the fundamentals of JS, you must become familiar with
          how functions work and interact. To start a function, you begin with
          the <em>function</em> keyword, followed by a name of your choice for 
          said function. This name can be anything, but it helps to name it 
          in a way that gives you or whoever else who may be reading the code an 
          idea of what the function actually does. Let's look at an example:</p>
          <pre><code class="codeSnippet">
          let myName = "Kyle";
          let myAge = 26;

          function helloWorld(myName, myAge) {
            document.write (myName + " is " + myAge + " years old.");
          }
          </code></pre>
        <p>In the above example, the function is first named <em>helloWorld</em>. 
          Next, within the parentheses following the function's name, we give it
          parameters using the <em>let variables</em> defined above as 
          "myName" and "myAge." Next, within curly brackets, we see code statements 
          that define the function. The parameters are passed through the function 
          and can be captured and manipulated. This statement will write a string 
          of text to a document stream.

  <!--Objects-->
  <section class="codeSection">
      <div class="transparentBox">
        <h2><a name="linkToObjects">Objects</a></h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, an <em>object</em> is a grouping of correlated data that 
        can be accessed using <em>bracket notation</em>, not unlike how you would
        access data in an array. Each property within an object is associated with 
        a string value, making it easy to equate an object to an array. Much like 
        many other things in JavaScript syntax, we start by initializing a variable. 
        Let's look at an example:</p>
        <pre><code class="codeSnippet">
        let person = {
          name: "Kyle",
          age: 26,
          gender: "male",
          veryTired: true,
        };
        console.log(person.veryTired);
        </code></pre>
        <p>An object is composed of multiple different <em>members</em>, each with 
        a different name and value. For instance, the member "age" has a number value
        of 26. Members and value are separated by a colon and comma and the entire
        object ends with a semicolon. You can store just about anything you want in 
        an object, each with varying values and names. Information within an object 
        can be accessed through <em>dot notation</em> as seen in the above example. 
        After the object has been defined, the console has been told to log the 
        "veryTired" member which will print out as "true."</p>

  <!--Arrays-->
  <section class="codeSection">
      <div class="transparentBox">
        <h2><a name="linkToArrays">Arrays</a></h2>
        <p>The idea behind a JavaScript <em>array</em> is that it acts as a list 
        of values that you can access through an integer that is known as a <em>key</em>. 
        It is important to note that the list of values held within an array count 
        upwards from 0 instead of 1 as might be expected. Here's what an array 
        might look like:</p>
        <code class="codeSnippet"><pre>
        let myDinner = ['pasta', 'sauce', 'spices', 'chicken', 'cheese']
        
        console.log(myDinner.length);
        </pre></code>
        <p>In essence, the array functions as an object. In fact, if you were to 
        log the type of the variable "myDinner" to the console, it would tell you 
        that it is an object. Like most JavaScript code, you begin the array by 
        defining it. In this case, we've given our array the name "myDinner" and 
        filled in its contents using square brackets. To access the values within 
        this object, you must keep in mind that, since the array counts up from 0, 
        the key for 'sauce' is considered 1, not 2. Thus, 'pasta' is 0, 'sauce' is 1, 
        'spices' is 2, 'chicken' is 3, and finally 'cheese' is 4.
